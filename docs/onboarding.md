# LORE-LLM Onboarding Guide

Welcome aboard! This guide gives new contributors the minimum context and repeatable steps to get productive with LOREâ€‘LLM. Keep it handy for the first few days and update it whenever you discover gaps.

---

## 1. Project at a Glance

| Concern | Quick Summary |
| --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | CLI-driven localization pipeline that extracts raw text, enriches it with context (metadata, clusters, knowledge), and prepares machine-translation workflows. |
| **Tech stack** | .NET 8 (C#), `CSharpFunctionalExtensions`, `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting`, `System.CommandLine`, xUnit + Shouldly + NSubstitute. |
| **Artifacts** | JSON/TOML files under a per-project workspace (`source_text_raw.json`, `knowledge_base.json`, `investigation.json`, etc.). |
| **CLI verbs** | `extract`, `augment`, `translate`, `validate`, `integrate`, `investigate`. Each lives in `src/LORE-LLM/Presentation/Commands/<Verb>`. |

---

## 2. Get Set Up

1. **Install prerequisites**
   - .NET 8 SDK (`dotnet --list-sdks` should show `8.x`).
   - Git, your editor of choice (Rider, VS, VS Code).
   - Optional: PowerShell 7+ for repo scripts.

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<org>/LORE-LLM.git
   cd LORE-LLM
   ```

3. **Restore & build**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet test
   ```
   You should see zero warnings (nullable + analyzers are treated as errors).

4. **Run the CLI help**
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/LORE-LLM -- --help
   ```
   Review each verbâ€™s help (`--help`) to understand the surface area.

---

## 3. Repository Layout Cheatsheet

```
LORE-LLM/
â”œâ”€ docs/                  -> Plans, backlogs, schemas, onboarding
â”œâ”€ src/
â”‚  â””â”€ LORE-LLM/
â”‚      â”œâ”€ Application/    -> Use cases (extract/investigate/etc.)
â”‚      â”œâ”€ Domain/         -> Core records & services
â”‚      â”œâ”€ Infrastructure/ -> IO, ingestion, persistence adapters
â”‚      â””â”€ Presentation/   -> CLI commands, option binding
â”œâ”€ tests/
â”‚  â””â”€ LORE-LLM.Tests/     -> Unit & CLI integration tests
â””â”€ samples/ (if present)  -> Example workspaces & input data
```

Stick to vertical slices: Domain â†’ Application â†’ Presentation. Infrastructure helpers slot in as needed but avoid cross-coupling.

---

## 4. Day-One Tasks

1. **Read the backlog and project plan**  
   - `docs/backlog.md` shows completed vertical slices and current priorities.  
   - `docs/LORE-LLM_Project_Plan.md` covers long-term vision, phases, and data assumptions.

2. **Run an extraction sample (if available)**  
   - Follow `docs/examples/` or sample workspace instructions.  
   - `dotnet run --project src/LORE-LLM -- extract --project ./samples/pathologic2`

3. **Skim the schemas**  
   - Understand JSON contracts in `docs/schemas/`.  
   - Knowing field names speeds up debugging later.

---

## 5. Development Workflow Expectations

- **Branching**: `main` stays clean. Branch off (`feature/<short-desc>`) and open PRs with linked backlog items.
- **Testing**: Run `dotnet test` before every PR. Add or update tests alongside code changes.
- **Linting**: Analyzers + nullable are enforced. Fix warnings locally before pushing.
- **Functional style**: We favor `Result<T>` / `Maybe<T>` across layers. Keep exceptions for truly exceptional cases.
- **CLI UX**: Every command should return a deterministic exit code and log meaningful progress/error messages.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting & Help

| Problem | Try this first |
| --- | --- |
| Build fails with analyzer warnings | Run `dotnet format` (if configured) or fix the warnings; they block compilation. |
| CLI command canâ€™t find workspace files | Confirm youâ€™re passing `--project`/`--workspace` pointing to a folder containing `workspace.toml`. |
| Investigation command slow or failing | Delete cached wiki data under the project workspace and rerun with `--force-refresh`. |
| Unsure where a service lives | Search under `src/LORE-LLM/Application` for the verb; follow the DI registrations in `Program.cs` / `DependencyInjection` extensions. |

If you get stuck, drop questions in the teamâ€™s chat channel or open a draft PR and tag a maintainer.

## 7. Next Updates

- Keep this document current: add new CLI verbs, change prerequisites, or note common pitfalls as the project evolves.
- Consider automating setup (scripts, sample workspace) once the onboarding steps stabilize.

Welcome againâ€”happy shipping! ðŸŽ‰
