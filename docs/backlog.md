# Backlog

- [x] VS-0001 Scaffold solution structure (single console project + tests) with vertical-slice friendly wiring and DI bootstrap.
  - Created `LORE-LLM.sln` with projects: `src/LORE-LLM` (console app) and `tests/LORE-LLM.Tests` (xUnit).
  - Tests reference `Shouldly`/`NSubstitute`; core references `CSharpFunctionalExtensions`.
  - Added `Directory.Build.props` enforcing nullable reference types, analyzers, and warnings-as-errors (excluding tests).
  - Implemented composition root via `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting` with DI extension `AddLoreLlmServices` registering the placeholder CLI application.
- [x] VS-0002 Define CLI surface (System.CommandLine) and register initial verbs: `extract`, `augment`, `translate`, `validate`, `integrate`.
  - Each command lives in its own feature module under `Presentation/Commands/<Verb>`.
  - Wire binding models, help text, and minimal handlers returning `Result<int>` via `CSharpFunctionalExtensions`.
  - Root command built with System.CommandLine 2.0 `Parse().InvokeAsync()` flow; stub handlers log intent while returning exit codes.
  - Add unit tests covering command invocation and option parsing.
- [x] VS-0003 Implement raw text extraction pipeline.
  - Added `RawTextExtractor` service + `SourceSegment`/`SourceTextRawDocument` models; command now writes project-scoped `source_text_raw.json` and `workspace.json` with SHA-256 manifest data.
  - Handles ID-only lines by emitting empty segments and skips blank rows; fails gracefully on missing input/no segments.
  - Added integration tests for CLI extract verb plus dedicated unit tests validating JSON/manifest output.
- [x] VS-0004 Define schemas for metadata, clusters, knowledge, and investigation.
  - Add strongly typed records for `SegmentMetadata`, `ClusterContext`, `KnowledgeEntry`, and `InvestigationSuggestion` (linkage between segments and indexed wiki articles).
  - Document JSON schemas in `docs/schemas/` and provide examples in `docs/examples/` for metadata, clusters, wiki knowledge entries, and investigation reports.
  - Build wiki ingestion scaffold using the MediaWiki API (e.g., `action=query&list=allpages`, `prop=extracts|info`) to cache article metadata (title, summary, license, last updated) and produce an investigation report that cross-references segments with wiki suggestions.
  - Ensure serialization tests cover round-trip validation for the new models and their artifacts.
- [x] VS-0005 Introduce post-processing pipeline.
  - Define `IPostExtractionProcessor` (or similar) and register per-project processors via DI/config.
  - Implement Marble Nest processor that removes empty segments or other quest-specific quirks after extraction.
  - Add CLI wiring (e.g., optional `--post-process` flag or default run) and tests verifying processors mutate workspace artifacts correctly.
  - Document processor extension points and add an example config entry in the docs.
- [x] VS-0006 Implement investigation stage.
  - Added `investigate` CLI command that reads `source_text_raw.json`, generates `investigation.json`, and refreshes the workspace manifest.
  - Implemented token heuristics and candidate matching backed by a MediaWiki ingestion service (opensearch + parse) with on-disk caching and knowledge base emission.
  - Investigation workflow now persists `knowledge_base.json`, updates manifest artifacts, and surfaces wiki-backed candidates per segment.
  - Expanded unit and CLI coverage around the pipeline and refreshed docs/examples for the new artifacts.
- [ ] VS-0007 Prefilter wiki ingestion via keyword index.
  - Cache MediaWiki `allpages` listings (titles, aliases) under the workspace and normalize to a keyword index.
  - Map extracted segment tokens to indexed pages to prioritize ingestion requests and avoid unnecessary API calls.
  - Thread the filtered candidate list into `EnsureKnowledgeBaseAsync`, falling back to configurable top-N when matches are sparse.
  - Update investigation tests/docs to cover the narrowed fetch path and cache lifecycle options (`--force-refresh`, offline mode).
- [ ] VS-0008 Investigate integration pipeline consumes wiki context.
  - Merge `investigation.json` and `knowledge_base.json` insights back into the augmentation stage (e.g., enrich metadata with matched concepts, confidence scores, excerpt snippets).
  - Surface annotated lore in downstream artifacts/previews so translation prompt assembly can leverage it.
  - Add CLI parameterization for enabling/disabling lore injection and document the expectations in the onboarding guide.
