# Backlog

- [x] VS-0001 Scaffold solution structure (single console project + tests) with vertical-slice friendly wiring and DI bootstrap.
  - Created `LORE-LLM.sln` with projects: `src/LORE-LLM` (console app) and `tests/LORE-LLM.Tests` (xUnit).
  - Tests reference `Shouldly`/`NSubstitute`; core references `CSharpFunctionalExtensions`.
  - Added `Directory.Build.props` enforcing nullable reference types, analyzers, and warnings-as-errors (excluding tests).
  - Implemented composition root via `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting` with DI extension `AddLoreLlmServices` registering the placeholder CLI application.
- [x] VS-0002 Define CLI surface (System.CommandLine) and register initial verbs: `extract`, `augment`, `translate`, `validate`, `integrate`.
  - Each command lives in its own feature module under `Presentation/Commands/<Verb>`.
  - Wire binding models, help text, and minimal handlers returning `Result<int>` via `CSharpFunctionalExtensions`.
  - Root command built with System.CommandLine 2.0 `Parse().InvokeAsync()` flow; stub handlers log intent while returning exit codes.
  - Add unit tests covering command invocation and option parsing.
- [x] VS-0003 Implement raw text extraction pipeline.
  - Added `RawTextExtractor` service + `SourceSegment`/`SourceTextRawDocument` models; command now writes project-scoped `source_text_raw.json` and `workspace.json` with SHA-256 manifest data.
  - Handles ID-only lines by emitting empty segments and skips blank rows; fails gracefully on missing input/no segments.
  - Added integration tests for CLI extract verb plus dedicated unit tests validating JSON/manifest output.
- [x] VS-0004 Define schemas for metadata, clusters, knowledge, and investigation.
  - Add strongly typed records for `SegmentMetadata`, `ClusterContext`, `KnowledgeEntry`, and `InvestigationSuggestion` (linkage between segments and indexed wiki articles).
  - Document JSON schemas in `docs/schemas/` and provide examples in `docs/examples/` for metadata, clusters, wiki knowledge entries, and investigation reports.
  - Build wiki ingestion scaffold using the MediaWiki API (e.g., `action=query&list=allpages`, `prop=extracts|info`) to cache article metadata (title, summary, license, last updated) and produce an investigation report that cross-references segments with wiki suggestions.
  - Ensure serialization tests cover round-trip validation for the new models and their artifacts.
- [x] VS-0005 Introduce post-processing pipeline.
  - Define `IPostExtractionProcessor` (or similar) and register per-project processors via DI/config.
  - Implement Marble Nest processor that removes empty segments or other quest-specific quirks after extraction.
  - Add CLI wiring (e.g., optional `--post-process` flag or default run) and tests verifying processors mutate workspace artifacts correctly.
  - Document processor extension points and add an example config entry in the docs.
- [ ] VS-0006 Implement investigation stage.
  - Create `investigate` CLI verb (or augment existing one) that reads `source_text_raw.json`, runs token/entity detection, and produces project-scoped `investigation.json` using the schema.
  - Build MediaWiki ingestion service leveraging the API to fetch page indices, summaries, and metadata; cache locally with attribution.
  - Match segments to knowledge entries (scoring with heuristics/LLM), generate candidate suggestions, and integrate with the new domain models.
  - Add tests covering MediaWiki ingestion (mocked), investigation matching logic, and CLI integration; update docs/examples with generated artifacts.
