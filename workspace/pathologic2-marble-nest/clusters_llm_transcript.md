It's a clear sign: wherever there are kids, there is trouble. It's just the games they play—malicious games. I wouldn't be surprised to find out this whole outbreak was just a game of theirs too."

Abandoned their camp behind the Cathedral yesterday. The ones who stayed are preparing a funeral of some sorts. Secondly, the Judge has kindly gone off his rocker.

But in reality you are lying here, delirious, clinging to the naive hope that this terrible house is a product of your imagination—a prophetic nightmare."

And fear won't help you understand how to die properly.\nEven without the understanding, you will still die, Bachelor, but it won't be a true death. To the contrary; it will be your complete, absolute end. You will simply cease to be. It's not quite as unpleasant as eternal damnation, but still rather less than thrilling."

Anyone who felt weak or unwell was led to the Cathedral, but it's obvious that none of them were infected. So, will you settle our argument…?"
