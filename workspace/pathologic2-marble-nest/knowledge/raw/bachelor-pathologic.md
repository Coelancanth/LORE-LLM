**Daniil Dankovsky** — also known as the **Bachelor** — is an expert on thanatology summoned to town by [Isidor Burakh](/wiki/Isidor_Burakh "Isidor Burakh"), who claims to hold proof to further advance Dankovsky's research on death. He is one of three playable characters alongside the [Haruspex](/wiki/Haruspex "Haruspex") and the [Changeling](/wiki/Changeling "Changeling"). 
 
## Description

| “ | The history of humanity witnessed a number of catastrophes that have demonstrated without a shadow of a doubt the pettiness of human achievement and the triumph of the invincible Evil. Outbreaks of infectious diseases that have from time to time wiped towns and cities off the map are undoubtedly among those.
<br>*However smart and virtuous, the people caught up in these destructive events have repeatedly come to the conclusion that it's no use trying to fight these circumstances; the best you can do is bite the bullet and cope with your losses.* <br><br>*This is the story of a person who has managed to work a miracle and defeat a seemingly unvanquishable foe.* | „ |
| --- | --- | --- |

Dankovsky is a young and dashing Bachelor of Medicine from the [Capital](/wiki/Capital "Capital") with a brilliant and determined mind, but also someone who carries with his persona a considerable notion of self-importance. He often recites Latin quotes. 

Dankovsky has a strong sense of justice, and uses logic and knowledge to accomplish his goals. His way of thinking often clashes with the more traditional ways of the Steppe, which brings out in him a temper and an impatience when dealing with others. He is good-natured and cares about the townsfolk, but he still shows a friendlier disposition to those that share his analytical and sceptical mind. 

Dankovsky is an adherent of logic and knowledge. He relies upon cold reason, not letting superstitions and the incompetence of others interfere in his work. 
 
## Background

| “ | Daniil Dankovsky, a Bachelor of Medicine, was brought here by circumstances most unfortunate. Dankovsky's lifework, his theory challenging the existing notions of human mortality, is being harshly persecuted by the Powers That Be. Suddenly a letter arrives from a colleague, suggesting that there is previously undiscovered evidence which may support Dankovsky's claims.
<br>*There is a settlement, the letter says, ruled by an extraordinary man who may well be seen as objective proof of Dankovsky's daring hypothesis. Grasping at straws of hope, Dankovsky decides to follow what he believes to be a sign of divine providence. Without further ado, he sets off for the settlement*. | „ |

|  | —"The Invisible Enemy" Route Introduction |

After earning a degree in medicine, Dankovsky founded the infamous laboratory [Thanatica](/wiki/Thanatica "Thanatica"), where he and a close circle of his associates researched death itself and possible ways to cure it. It is mentioned that in his past, he once met [Aglaya Lilich](/wiki/The_Inquisitor "The Inquisitor") during a presentation where he reanimated dead tissue, and briefly attended the same university as [Andrey Stamatin](/wiki/Andrey_Stamatin "Andrey Stamatin").^[2]^  

From his colleague and correspondent, [Isidor Burakh](/wiki/Isidor_Burakh "Isidor Burakh"), Dankovsky learns about a 150 year old man named [Simon Kain](/wiki/Simon_Kain "Simon Kain"), who seems to have achieved immortality. Dankovsky makes his way to [the Town-on-Gorkhon](/wiki/The_Town "The Town") to meet the old man and verify his age and hopes that in doing so, he can save his laboratory from interference from the Powers That Be. He arrives in the Town by train and stays at the Stillwater, [Eva Yan](/wiki/Eva_Yan "Eva Yan")'s house. 

In a conversation that you can have with one of the children in the town Dankovsky claims that as a young child he wanted to become a military man, and that his parents though he would become a great conqueror some day. This was somewhere around the end of the latest war. In a conversation with the Inquisitor, he can further elaborate that his father was an officer, who only abandoned the hopes of making a soldier out of him after he had enrolled in the university. 
 
## Appearance
 
The Bachelor has short black hair kept trimmed above his ears, dark eyes, thick eyebrows, and a short stubble on his chin. He wears a black snakeskin coat, layered with what seems to be another maroon coloured coat beneath, though it is possible that it is the lining of the snakeskin coat. He wears a black shirt beneath, with a brown necktie. He wears black pants and large leather boots. He is always wearing black leather gloves and carrying a black travel bag, usually referred to as a [carpetbag](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/carpetbag). Many characters in game refer to him as a dandy due to his "handsome" means of dress. 
 
## Gameplay Abilities
 
The Bachelor carries a special device, called the [Plaguefinder](/wiki/Plaguefinder "Plaguefinder"), which allows him to detect contagious clouds of [the Plague](/wiki/The_Plague "The Plague") at a great distance in order to avoid them. He also starts the game with a pair of [Medical Gloves](/wiki/Resources#Clothes "Resources") and a [Scalpel](/wiki/Resources#Weapons "Resources"), but may use other weapons as he chooses. The Plaguefinder device may be upgraded using [Lenses](/wiki/Lens "Lens"). 

Unlike the other playable characters, the Bachelor may not participate in [rat races](/wiki/Rat_Racing "Rat Racing"), gather herbs, or trade with Worms. However, the Bachelor is still able to fight in the [Circle of Suok](/wiki/Circle_of_Suok "Circle of Suok") for rewards.  
 
## Plot
 
#### Bachelor Route
 
*Main article: *[[:[Bachelor Route](/wiki/Bachelor_Route "Bachelor Route")|[Bachelor Route](/wiki/Bachelor_Route "Bachelor Route")]]

 The initial objective of the Bachelor is to save [Thanatica](/wiki/Thanatica "Thanatica") and to uncover the secret of immortality. To do this he arrives in [The Town](/wiki/The_Town "The Town") on behest of Isidor Burakh to meet [Simon Kain](/wiki/Simon_Kain "Simon Kain"), a man that appears to be immortal. Unfortunately Simon Kain died due to mysterious circumstances prior to his arrival. Many believe that Simon was murdered but, as evidence is uncovered, it seems as though Simon Kain (and, as is uncovered later, Isidor Burakh) was killed not by a person, but by an unknown disease. Now placed into a Town with any hope of leaving vanquished he seeks to defeat the plague and save the Town. The Bachelor's goal then becomes to preserve the [Polyhedron](/wiki/The_Polyhedron "The Polyhedron") and [those associated with it](/wiki/The_Utopians "The Utopians"). 
 
#### Haruspex Route
 
As an outsider, the Bachelor is unable to acquire the organic tissues he requires to determine the natural and origin of the outbreak. Instead, he relies on the Haruspex's aid to not only bypass the Town's peculiar superstitions but to also peer into those places in the Town he is forbidden from such as the [Abattoir](/wiki/Abattoir "Abattoir").  

On **Day 1**, the [Haruspex](/wiki/Haruspex "Haruspex") is initially advised to avoid the Bachelor, who is angered by the deaths of [Simon](/wiki/Simon_Kain "Simon Kain") and [Isidor](/wiki/Isidor_Burakh "Isidor Burakh"). However, by the time they meet at 18:00, he is accepting of the Haruspex's innocence. By this point, he has discovered that Simon Kain was not murdered and, rather, died of an infectious disease of unknown origin. The pair decide to work together. 

On **Day 2**, after the Haruspex learns about his inheritance, the Bachelor will request that he make some tinctures as written in Isidor Burakh's notes for the Bachelor to analyze. After making one, the Haruspex gives it to the Bachelor at the Stillwater for him to examine. From this he concludes that it would be pertinent to attempt to study the effect of the natural agents within the mixtures against dead tissue. Through trial and error he believes he may be able to create a way to fight the [Plague](/wiki/Plague "Plague").  

On **Day 3**, the Bachelor will request that the Haruspex track down some infected tissue for him to study as he does not have the means to collect it himself. The Haruspex may bring him Infected Blood, an Infected Heart, an Infected Kidney, or an Infected Liver. Upon returning to the Bachelor, he may choose between rewards of immunogens (5 [Beta-Tablets](/wiki/Beta-Tablets "Beta-Tablets") and 1 [Delta-Tablets](/wiki/Delta-Tablets "Delta-Tablets")), painkillers (1 [Novocaine](/wiki/Novocaine "Novocaine"), 1 [Morphine](/wiki/Morphine "Morphine"), and 1 [Etorphine](/wiki/Etorphine "Etorphine")), antibiotics (1 [Ferromycinium](/wiki/Ferromycinium "Ferromycinium"), 1 [Neomycinium](/wiki/Neomycinium "Neomycinium"), 1 [Monomycinium](/wiki/Monomycinium "Monomycinium")), or 2 [Bandage Set](/wiki/Bandage_Set "Bandage Set"). 

On **Day 4**, the Bachelor tells the Haruspex to speak to [Lara Ravel](/wiki/Lara_Ravel "Lara Ravel") who, if his reputation is high enough, will direct him to [Stanislav Rubin](/wiki/Stanislav_Rubin "Stanislav Rubin"). 

On **Day 5**, the Bachelor will ask the Haruspex to find a fresh infected heart to study. There are three ways such an item can be acquired. The first two options are done through talking to Aspity who guides him to a Worm gathering hut where he may choose to take hearts from either the Herb Bride or the Butchers that are there. The third option is to kill Willow Mellow by the Broken Heart and taking hers. If the Haruspex gives Bachelor the Bride's Heart, the Bachelor will provide the Haruspex with money and a Blue Vaccine. If he is given a Butcher's Heart, the Bachelor will give a higher monetary reward and 2 bottles of the Black Vaccine. If he is given Willow's Heart, the Bachelor will accept it as a sample, but provide no reward. 

On **Day 6**, Haruspex receives a letter to talk to the Bachelor in the [Stillwater](/wiki/Stillwater "Stillwater") concerning testing the blood of bulls. Once the Haruspex is able to collect a vial of Bull's Blood, he is able to return to the Bachelor who will analyze it. Through his analysis he concludes that the bull's blood is useless to humans as the antibodies created in bulls is incompatible with humans.  

On the morning of **Day 7**, the Bachelor will send the Haruspex a letter asking him to make haste to the Stillwater if he wishes to discuss the results of their tests. Upon arriving, the Bachelor will advise the Haruspex to go to the Cathedral to meet the Inquisitor. He is planning to see the Inquisitor, though, after the Haruspex does.  

On **Day 9**, Foreman Oyun will ask the Haruspex to interrogate the Bachelor in the Stillwater. On arriving at the Stillwater, Eva Yan will inform the Haruspex that the Bachelor has gone to the Polyhedron and is not there. As it happens, the Bachelor has been captured by the Dogheads after attempting to give them blank rifle cartridges instead of live ammo. The Dogheads will request 30 rounds of Rifle Ammo to free him. If the Haruspex did not let Lika live and does not wish to kill the Dogheads, he can ask Eva in the Stillwater for help and she will provide him with all 30. 

On **Day 10**, the Bachelor will suggest that the Haruspex addresses Foreman Oyun with the question of his inheritance. On the same day, the Bachelor can be spoken to concerning to the unusual blood from the bull in the Bone Stake Lot and the blood pooling at the base of the Polyhedron. The Bachelor will also provide his interpretation on the Haruspex's "Udurgh". Unlike Foreman Oyun (who believes that Udurgh is the settlement) the Bachelor believes that the Udurgh was Simon Kain, who has such an influence on the Town he may as well have been called a "body that contains a world." He asks the Haruspex to ask Capella about his theory. Capella is sceptical about the interpretation but does agree that it is a possible interpretation of an Udurgh. Satisfied with the possibility that it may be his Udurgh the Bachelor then concludes that there is a possibility that the Udurgh can therefore possibly be the Polyhedron, too.  

On **Day 11**, the Haruspex will find the bull in the Bone Stake Lot burned before he could collect more blood for his Panacea. The military men at the Lot will direct the Haruspex to Captain Longin who will in turn direct him to the Bachelor in the Stillwater. The Bachelor will confess that it was he who had the bull destroyed as it posed a sanitary risk. In the evening, the Bachelor can provide the Haruspex with the password to enter the Polyhedron in order to see Khan on Capella's request. 

On **Day 12**, the Bachelor can be spoken to concerning the final decision. The Bachelor's choice is to destroy the Town and preserve the Polyhedron. He requires the [Utopians](/wiki/Utopians "Utopians") to be healthy to do so.  
 
#### Changeling Route
 
The Bachelor works to find the source of the [Plague](/wiki/Plague "Plague") while manufacturing his [Vaccine](/wiki/Vaccine "Vaccine") with [Rubin](/wiki/Stanislav_Rubin "Stanislav Rubin"). This puts him in the Changeling's path when she is accused of being a carrier of the disease. In later days, he is engaged in a rivalry with the [Haruspex](/wiki/Haruspex "Haruspex"). This often toes the line of deadly, with the two of them engaged in a game of cat and mouse throughout the town. The Changeling is able to help or hinder the Bachelor as she chooses. He is also willing to reward the Changeling for revealing her sister's hideouts. 

On **Day 1**, the man wounded by the [Haruspex](/wiki/Haruspex "Haruspex") can be found at the [Willows](/wiki/Willows "Willows"), alongside the Bachelor. A crowd has gathered in the corner of the mansion and may function as witnesses for the Changeling's healing powers. The Bachelor is somewhat disbelieving of the Changeling's powers, but he can hardly argue with his own eyes and agrees to testify for her to [Alexander Saburov](/wiki/Alexander_Saburov "Alexander Saburov"). 

On **Day 2**, the Changeling will encounter the Bachelor after she finds the [Harpist](/wiki/Harpist "Harpist") at the behest of [Lara Ravel](/wiki/Lara_Ravel "Lara Ravel"). He expresses surprise at seeing her there, as he had just met her - or rather, her twin - at the Willows. 

On **Day 3**, the Changeling learns that the Bachelor and the Haruspex's relationship has severely deteriorated and the two are now attempting to find each other and fight. She will be asked to find the Bachelor by both [Anna Angel](/wiki/Anna_Angel "Anna Angel") and [Capella](/wiki/Capella "Capella"). Capella will guide the Changeling to a house in the Hindquarters where the Bachelor had begun testing medicine. If the Changeling found the Haruspex before finding the Bachelor, she can tell the Bachelor where the Haruspex is and receive 2000 coins and one [Neomycinium](/wiki/Neomycinium "Neomycinium") pill. 

On **Day 5**, following conversations with the [Cathedral](/wiki/Cathedral "Cathedral") guards and [Maria Kaina](/wiki/Maria_Kaina "Maria Kaina"), the Changeling can ask the Bachelor for access to the Cathedral. While he doesn't have the key, he provides a useful tip regarding their need for water. 

On **Day 6**, the Changeling needs to find the Bachelor to help clear her name after rumours spread that she was the one that caused everyone in the Cathedral to become infected and die. He is making his own rounds to inspect the blood of women in the Town that are also under suspicion, so he will appear in different houses depending on the time.  

From the morning until 14:00, the Bachelor will be at the Willows. From 14:00 to 16:00, the Bachelor will be at the [Shelter](/wiki/Shelter "Shelter"). From 16:00 to 18:00, the Bachelor will be at [Aspity's Hospice](/wiki/Aspity%27s_Hospice "Aspity&#39;s Hospice"). After 18:00, the Bachelor will be at the [Stillwater](/wiki/Stillwater "Stillwater"). Regardless of where the Changeling finds the Bachelor, after talking to him, she will be brought to the Stillwater. He examines her blood and concludes she is innocent, but forces her to stay there in order to prove for sure that she is not the one infecting people. 

On **Day 7**, the Changeling will still be at the Stillwater and talks to the Bachelor, who gives her 1000 coins and lets her go. Later in the day, she will find him again at the Theatre when she is investigating why he was sent to the Town. He asks her for the [Executor Mask](/wiki/Executor_Mask "Executor Mask") and once she gives it to him, he will tell her about the [Inquisitor](/wiki/Aglaya_Lilich "Aglaya Lilich") and [The Powers That Be](/wiki/The_Powers_That_Be "The Powers That Be"). The Bachelor also tells her to look for the Haruspex in the [Termitary](/wiki/Termitary "Termitary") to get more information. He then asks her to deliver a Shotgun to a [Worm](/wiki/Worm "Worm") who lives at the western-most herb gathering hut in the Steppe. 

On **Day 8**, he will be found in a house east of the [Town Hall](/wiki/Town_Hall "Town Hall"), both hiding from and hunting for the Haruspex. 

On **Day 9**, the Changeling will initially run into the Bachelor on the first floor of the Short Block of the Termitary. She asks him about Rubin and Simon Kain's body. Later, the Bachelor will be in a house east of [Andrey Stamatin's Pub](/wiki/Andrey_Stamatin%27s_Pub "Andrey Stamatin&#39;s Pub").  

On **Day 10**, the Changeling finds the Bachelor at Rubin's Prosectorium. He tells her that Rubin went to see the Kains and hasn't returned. Later that day, she can find him in a house in the Mouth district, next to the grocery store.  

On **Day 11**, the Changeling needs to find the Bachelor and deliver him something on behalf of the Inquisitor. She needs to first deal with the mutiny at the [Train Station](/wiki/Train_Station "Train Station"), before she learns that the Bachelor and Andrey Stamatin had managed to escape from the soldiers and will be at [Stamatin's Loft](/wiki/Stamatin%27s_Loft "Stamatin&#39;s Loft"). The Changeling gives the Bachelor the papers from the Inquisitor. He will ask for her help in defeating both the Haruspex and the Inquisitor. Later that day, she can find him again in a building that is northeast of Maria's Wing of the [Crucible](/wiki/Crucible "Crucible"). 

On **Day 12**, the Bachelor is in the Stillwater, and can be spoken to concerning the final decision. The Bachelor's choice is to destroy the Town and preserve the Polyhedron. He requires the [Utopians](/wiki/Utopians "Utopians") to be healthy to do so.
