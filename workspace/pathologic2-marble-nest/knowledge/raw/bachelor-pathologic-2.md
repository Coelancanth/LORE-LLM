Bachelor Daniil Dankovsky is a famed thanatologist, having dedicated his life to study the effects of death and the possibilities of immortality. He reveres rationale over all, blinding him to the more effective solutions of the [Haruspex](/wiki/Haruspex "Haruspex") and [Changeling](/wiki/Changeling "Changeling"). Throughout the story, he is tasked with discovering a vaccine for the plague outbreak and to curb further infection. 
 
## Background
 
Dankovsky is a Bachelor of medicine and an expert on thanatology. He is the lead of the [Thanatica](/wiki/Thanatica "Thanatica"); a research lab in the [Capital](/wiki/Capital "Capital") that is dedicated to the ambitious goal of destroying Death itself. His work has made him a celebrity and he is renowned even to the people of the Town.^[1]^ It is evident that his research not only drew awe, but some ire as well as there are powers who would prefer to have him quietly disposed of.^[2]^ 

As a child he collected [Beetles](/wiki/Beetle "Beetle") and has since left the collection with his father.^[3]^ 
 
## Appearance
 
The Bachelor has short black hair trimmed into a bowl cut, dark hazel eyes, and often looks to be in thought. He wears a black snakeskin jacket, unbuttoned, and a white dress shirt with a red vest underneath. He has a red cravat tied around his neck, and a snake cravat pin that is incorrectly pinned to it. A silver belt buckle depicting a serpent sits atop his black dress pants, with sleek black shoes on to match. He wears black leather gloves. Many characters in game refer to him as a dandy due to his "handsome" means of dress. 
 
## Plot
 
### Haruspex Route
 
Summoned to town by [Isidor Burakh](/wiki/Isidor_Burakh "Isidor Burakh"), who claims to hold proof to further advance his research on death, the Bachelor arrives in the Town shortly before the outbreak of the Sand [Plague](/wiki/Plague "Plague"). He becomes a pupil of the [Kains](/wiki/The_Ruling_Families "The Ruling Families"),^[4]^ staying nearby their [Crucible](/wiki/Crucible "Crucible") in [Eva Yan](/wiki/Eva_Yan "Eva Yan")'s [Stillwater](/wiki/Stillwater "Stillwater"). Dankovsky quickly makes the acquaintance of [Stanislav Rubin](/wiki/Stanislav_Rubin "Stanislav Rubin"), taking him as his colleague and aide. He later attempts to do the same to the [Haruspex](/wiki/Haruspex "Haruspex") but finds his proposal rejected.  

In the days leading up to the beginning of the epidemic the Bachelor makes a name for himself, gaining the reputation of being quick on the draw. Some of the Townsfolk see him as self-assured and self-absorbed, claiming that he will only bring the Town harm. His refusal to help [Notkin](/wiki/Notkin "Notkin")'s Soul-and-a-Halves with their poisoned dogs does not endear him to them either and he gains a sour reputation among some of the Town's children. This is only amplified by his refusal to help Patches - a boy infected with Sand Pest on the first day of the epidemic - despite being a Doctor whose expertise could have possibly helped the boy. 

On the second day the Bachelor is involved with [Isidor Burakh's House](/wiki/Isidor_Burakh%27s_House "Isidor Burakh&#39;s House"), where he has arrived with a quarantine order for the building. Depending on the time of arrival the Haruspex will either meet him while exiting the house, or while attempting to enter. If the Haruspex arrives before midnight the Bachelor is standing outside as he leaves, demanding that the house be inspected. The Haruspex, who does not plan to live in the home anyway, reluctantly agrees. If the Haruspex arrives after midnight the house has already been quarantined along with the rest of the district. In this case the Bachelor is found on the doorstep speaking to an [Executor](/wiki/Executor "Executor"), and gives the Haruspex the [Rusty Key](/wiki/Rusty_Key "Rusty Key") he would have found in Isidor’s Room had he been able to enter himself.  

Following the beginning of the epidemic the Bachelor is placed in charge of most quarantine measures,^[5]^ supply,^[6]^ and the creation of the Hospital.^[7]^ Alongside this he is also in charge of the creation of an isolation ward in the [Cathedral](/wiki/Cathedral "Cathedral") and eventually heads the management of the [Cemetery](/wiki/Cemetery "Cemetery").^[7]^ It falls to him to ensure the Town continues to have enough water,^[8]^ and it is through him that the Fund is created.^[9]^ While maintaining medical order in the Town the Bachelor works on a vaccine, testing infected tissues and blood samples provided to him by the [Haruspex](/wiki/Haruspex "Haruspex"). With the aid of [Stanislav Rubin](/wiki/Stanislav_Rubin "Stanislav Rubin") the Bachelor succeeds in creating a vaccine, though it only provides temporary protection from the Sand Plague.^[10]^ 

In the final days of the epidemic the Bachelor turns his eye to the [Polyhedron](/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron"). He becomes infatuated with the structure, fascinated by its impossible architecture and with the fact that it is impenetrable to disease. He goes to extreme lengths to protect it from harm, even going so far as to murder an Inquisitorial Courier carrying orders for it's destruction. 

In the Diurnal Ending the Bachelor can be found drinking at the [Broken Heart](/wiki/Broken_Heart "Broken Heart") alongside [Peter Stamatin](/wiki/Peter_Stamatin "Peter Stamatin"), [Andrey Stamatin](/wiki/Andrey_Stamatin "Andrey Stamatin"), and [Yulia Lyuricheva](/wiki/Yulia_Lyuricheva "Yulia Lyuricheva").  

In the Nocturnal Ending he flees the Town with those who can no longer live within the Town's borders, namely many of the [Utopians](/wiki/Bound "Bound") and [Humbles](/wiki/Bound "Bound").  
 
### Pathologic: The Marble Nest

| “ | I don't intend to stay here for long. | „ |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | —**Bachelor**'s Hover details on his home in the Marble Nest |

The events of The Marble Nest take place on the tenth day of the outbreak, as experienced by the Bachelor. 

The Bachelor awakens in a coffin within a small room, disoriented and unsure of when and where he is. He is soon confronted by [Aspity](/wiki/Aspity "Aspity"), who chides him for failing to discover the source of the [Sand Plague](/wiki/The_Plague "The Plague") in the [Stone Yard](/wiki/The_Town "The Town") the previous day. Passing by the corpse of [Dora Feugel](/wiki/Dora_Feugel "Dora Feugel"), Bachelor learns from an orderly that the quarantined refugees from across the river have all perished. Bachelor stumbles away from the grisly scene to discover that Dora is alive. Dora tells Bachelor that she and [Marat Ranin](/wiki/Marat_Ranin "Marat Ranin") had been certain that he was dead, and that Marat was furious with him for his failure. Upstairs, Bachelor finds Marat, who accuses him of having been apathetic to the plight of those endangered by the Plague. Following the argument, Marat assaults Bachelor, who overpowers him and beats him to death. Attempting to leave, Bachelor finds an [Executor](/wiki/Executor "Executor"), who repeatedly asks him to accept his death. Refusing, Bachelor instead steps out onto the heady plague-ridden street, where he promptly blacks out. 

Bachelor is awoken by [Sticky](/wiki/Sticky "Sticky"), who informs him both that [The Judge](/wiki/Georgiy_Kain "Georgiy Kain") had come looking for him and that his friend [Blacky](/wiki/Blacky "Blacky")'s stepfather is sick. Concluding that he had witnessed a prophetic nightmare, Bachelor sets out to find the carrier of the Plague. He soon learns that he had been presumed dead, and that The Judge had assumed his position of authority and ordered an end to the quarantine. The Judge later tells him that he had met with the carrier but decided to let them go in order to test the resilience of the Town. 

Setting to tracking down the carrier, Bachelor determines that Blacky's stepfather has died of a stroke rather than Sand Plague. He also finds Dora and Marat self-quarantined in the [Cathedral](/wiki/The_Cathedral "The Cathedral"); however, he is unable to determine if they are suffering from the Plague, and sends them to his lodgings in order to reexamine them later. Bachelor also investigates rumors of a funeral in the [Steppe encampment](/wiki/The_Kin "The Kin") outside of town; at the bequest of an [Herb Bride](/wiki/Herb_Brides "Herb Brides"), he dresses an Odongh's self-inflicted wound, unwittingly enabling an Herb Bride sacrificial marriage to take place. Sometime during the day, Bachelor also finds a crowd of people waiting for Aspity to interpret their dreams. Aspity once again rebukes Bachelor for refusing to accept or understand death, and demonstrates how to "die properly"—crumpling to the ground before him, lifeless, only to reappear outside. Eventually, [Sleepy Head](/wiki/Sleepy_Head "Sleepy Head"), [Shrew](/wiki/Shrew "Shrew"), and Sticky alert Bachelor to the location of [the carriers](/wiki/Lotman_and_Siskin "Lotman and Siskin"), and he successfully orders their quarantine. The victory is short though, as an orderly informs Bachelor that a mob of sick refugees from across the river have made it through the barricades and dispersed throughout the Stone Yard. 

Come nightfall, the Plague takes hold and spreads throughout the streets of the Stone Yard; the air grows thick, and the tenement walls develop oozing, mottled sores. Townspeople take to the streets, killing an [Odongh](/wiki/Worm "Worm") out of suspicion that it is the carrier. At the evening bell, the townspeople begin travelling North for a funeral. Following the crowd, Bachelor is informed that a learned doctor from the [Capital](/wiki/Capital "Capital") has become the first victim of the Sand Plague in the Stone Yards. Pushing through the crowd, Bachelor enters his lodgings to find Sleepy Head, Shrew, Sticky, Dora, and Marat—all of whom speak to him as if they are watching over him while he feverishly sleeps. Fleeing the thunderous clamor of knocking emanating from the walls, Bachelor returns to the room that he had woken up in in his nightmare to find an Executor looming over a cradle where his coffin had been. Once again, the Executor urges Bachelor to accept his death, rather than playing out the events of the day once more, vainly trying to prevent the spread of the Plague. Upon the Bachelor's—or perhaps the Player's—refusal, the Executor leaves off, and bids him return to another fruitless loop. "Now close your eyes," says the Executor, "When you open them, a boy called Sticky will wake you up, and the Stone Yard will once again be free of infection. Perhaps this time you'll manage to prepare yourself for the inevitable. See you soon."

## Notes
 
- The Bachelor has a penchant for quoting Latin - often common sayings, idioms, and phrases. In ***[Pathologic 2](/wiki/Pathologic_2 "Pathologic 2")*** these are:

    - - *Medicum morbo adhibere* = "(In my opinion) A physician/doctor should handle the disease."^[11]^^[12]^
- *Qui habet aures, audiat* = "He who has ears, let him hear."^[13]^
- *Qui non proficit, deficit* = "The one who does not make progress loses ground."^[14]^
- *Totum revolutum* = "Total chaos." (A jumble, a mess of things)^[15]^
- *Scientia potentia est* = "Knowledge is power."^[16]^
- *Imperare sibi maximum imperium est* = "To rule oneself is the ultimate form of power."^[17]^

- In ***[Pathologic: The Marble Nest](/wiki/Pathologic:_The_Marble_Nest "Pathologic: The Marble Nest")*** these are:

    - - *Ab ovo* = "From the beginning" (Literally, from the egg)^[18]^
- *Post hoc non propter hoc* = "After this, not because of this." (Although event Y followed event X, this does not mean that Y must have been caused by event X). This is in reference to the post hoc fallacy; *Post hoc ergo propter hoc* ("After this, therefore because of this"). ^[19]^
- *Dura lex, sed lex* = "The Law is harsh, but it is the Law."^[20]^
- *Dum spiro, spero* = "While I breathe, I hope."^[21]^
- *Praemonitus praemunitus* = "Forewarned is forearmed."^[22]^
- *Cura te ipsum* - "Cure thyself." (from: *Medice, cura te ipsum* (*Physician, heal thyself*))^[23]^

- During the events of **Day 11** the Bachelor's hands become covered in blood. He will continue to have bloody hands in both the [Late](/wiki/Endings#Late "Endings") and [Deal](/wiki/Endings#Deal "Endings") ending provided the [Haruspex](/wiki/Haruspex "Haruspex") performed an action after the day roll at 7:30. If the Haruspex simply sleeps until the Late Ending the Bachelor will have clean hands instead. The same happens to the [Changeling](/wiki/Changeling "Changeling").
